# week-03-homework

## Description

Week three homework requires the creation of a password generator using JavaScript which we learned this week, as well as additional JavaScript which we had to search for and understand ourselves.

This project uses the following files;

- html
- JavaScript
- CSS

For this project I also decided to add a slider and checkboxes instead of using window prompts to make the user experience more dynamic and added copy to the clipboard for the user when they click the generated password.

Each time you change a variable the password refreshes, once you are happy with your variable selection you can press the "Generate Password" button as many times as you like until you have a password you are happy with.

## Installation

There are no steps to install this project, simply open the deployed website and enjoy.


## Usage
