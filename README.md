# week-03-homework

## Description

Week three homework requires the creation of a password generator using JavaScript which we learned this week, as well as additional JavaScript which we had to search for and understand ourselves.

This project includes the following files;

- index.html
- README.md
- script.js
- style.css

For this project I also decided to add a slider and checkboxes instead of using window prompts to make the user experience more dynamic and added copy to the clipboard for the user when they click the generated password.

## Installation

There are no steps to install this project, simply open the deployed website and enjoy.


## Usage

The webpage should be resized to less than 992px to see the smaller responsive design and less than 768px to see the smallest design and on a mobile device to see the mobile layout.
